# SEPP

Self-excited point process models of crime:

- Academic paper explaining the background mathematics, the EM algorithm and variations which have appeared in the literature, and giving trial results on Chicago crime data.
- Python library, built on top of
[`open_cp`](https://github.com/QuantCrimAtLeeds/PredictCode), implementing a large selection of SEPP models and fitting algorithms.
- Jupyter notebooks demoing the models on Chicago crime data.
